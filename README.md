# battleship
This is just a fun project creating a game of battleship. Experimenting with functional programming and ES6 features.

I have also developed some reusable functions and structures which may be helpful in future projects for interacting with the DOM and preserving DOM state.

A relatively recent version is running at https://joshuaheagle.com/battleship/
